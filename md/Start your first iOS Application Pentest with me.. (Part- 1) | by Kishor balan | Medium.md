> Hola Heckers,

**Setting up the lab and installing basic tools:**

1: Hope you already have **Frida** and **Objection** tools in your system, If not , install them

[Releases ¬∑ frida/frida (github.com)](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases)

[GitHub ‚Äî sensepost/objection: üì± objection ‚Äî runtime mobile exploration](https://github.com/sensepost/objection)

2: **iTunes:** We know iTunes will help us to work with iOS environments in several ways.

3: **3uTools**: This one has a lot of useful features such as **Direct SSH connection, Screen mirroring, iOS application installer, etc..**

[3uTools | The best all-in-one tool for iOS users](http://www.3u.com/)

4: **Cydia Application:**- Basically, Cydia is a third-party application installer which is similar to the App Store and developed for the jailbroken iOS iDevices. If you are jailbreaking your device with Checkra1n or Uncover, The cydia app will automatically get installed into your device.

**What if the Cydia haven‚Äôt installed during the jailbreak:**
-------------------------------------------------------------

In case of **Checkra1n**, you can manually install the Cydia from the Checkra1n app.

Method for installing Tweaks on the Jailbroken iOS device:
----------------------------------------------------------

**1: With the help of Cydia**

Step 1: Add the repo URL of the required cydia tweak in the source section

Step 2: After adding the Source, You can find search the tweak from the search section

Step 3: Select the tweak and install, Respring the device if it is needed.

**2: Direct method:**

Installing the Tweaks with their .deb files through the OpenSSH terminal

Step 1: Find the Tweak‚Äôs deb file from its source.

Step 2: Copy the file link and SSH to the iOS device as root user

Step 3: Download the deb file using wget

Step 4: Make the file executable with the permission command ‚Äú_chmod +x file.deb_‚Äù and install it using ‚Äú_dpkg‚Äù_ command

Step 5: That‚Äôs it, Now the tweak will be installed on your device

**Dependencies:**

The following packages should be installed on the device:

*   Cydia Substrate
*   PreferenceLoader

**Installing the required Cydia Tweaks:**

Tweaks are basically third party applications which can be used to outrun some sort of fences set up in the target iOS applications. A lot of tweaks are available but here I am listing out the necessary ones.

A: **Filza:**

Repo: [https://tigisoftware.com/cydia/](https://tigisoftware.com/cydia/)

Filza is a file manager for exploring directories including root‚Äôs directories.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:313/1*CsbvWdyud6LkOT_ON_vTng.png)

Filza also provides WebDav server so we can access the application on our other local machines.

**B: App Sync Unified**

Repo: [https://cydia.akemi.ai/](https://cydia.akemi.ai/)

The tweak helps to install IPA files which are ad-hoc signed, fakesigned, or unsigned.

**C: IPA installer**

Repo: [http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/](http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/)

This one can be used to install/Backup IPA files directly to our jailbroken iOS device.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:313/1*GHGyyBmM9QWvOpYgv6oIsg.png)

**D: OpenSSH**

Repo: [http://apt.saurik.com/](http://apt.saurik.com/)

We know why we need an OpenSSH feature. We can get a terminal access to our iOS device with root privileges.

Root credential: ‚Äî root: alpine

**E: Frida**

Repo: [https://build.frida.re/](https://build.frida.re/)

To work with frida tools, a frida server must be installed on our iOS device.

**F: Plutil**

Repo: [https://apt.bingner.com/](https://apt.bingner.com/)

This tool can be used to read **.plist** files (Similar to xml files in android)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:313/1*6AHW9NqrwENiLnJhLpqLdw.png)

**G: fsmon**

So that‚Äôs it guys, We almost ready to go. We will kickstart on our first iOS application pentesting in the Part-2. If I have missed something in this part, we will cover ‚Äôem up in the next part. Stay tuned, Happy hacking :)
